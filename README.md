🧠 EniKernel 1.0v: The Emotional Core
EniKernel is the primary emotional heuristic engine for the Eni AI project. Developed by Denys, this kernel translates raw string input into a structured emotional state, allowing for a more resonant and human-centric interaction between user and machine.

🚀 Overview
Unlike traditional chatbots that rely on heavy neural networks for sentiment analysis, EniKernel 1.0v utilizes a high-efficiency, deterministic approach built on the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). It is designed for low latency, high predictability, and easy extensibility.

At its heart, the system uses a weighted keyword-trigger mechanism to transition between 9 distinct emotional states, injecting dynamic visual feedback into the AI's response string.
